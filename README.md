# Data Structures
This repository is for the labs I completed through my University Data Structures course. This course was taught in the LISP programming languages so all labs are coded as such. The theory and curriculum stays rather consistent with other Data Structure sources.

Labs:
1. Editing, Running, and Testing Lisp Programs
2. Lisp Programming
3. Tuples (Structures) and Arrays
4. Array Sorting and Lists
5. Stacks (Queues)
6. Key-Value Hash Maps and Recursion
7. Hash-Tables
8. Trees and Creating your Lisp Dialect - uLisp (MicroLisp)
9. Graps and Spanning Trees
